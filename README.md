# Whisper - A FOSS Communication Platform
> _The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear._
--------------------------------------------
This project is an attempt to develop a platform that allows for secure E2EE communication between two or more clients.

It is being undertaken as my Third Year Project.

Currently the project is barebones and does not have any functionality apart from a very basic interface however, updates will be coming soon :)
