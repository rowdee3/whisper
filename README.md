# Whisper - A FOSS Communication Platform
> _The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear._
--------------------------------------------
This project is an attempt to develop a platform that allows for secure E2EE communication between two or more clients.

It is being undertaken as my Third Year Project.

Currently the project is barebones and does not have any functionality apart from a very basic interface however, updates will be coming soon :)

In order to use the program currently, just run it in a terminal using python3 main.py from the /src/ folder. I plan to create either an executable or batch script to automate this in the future.
It will automatically create a new directory, called 'data' and a CSV file called 'accounts'. If this folder already exists when cloned then delete it as it may be a test folder with corrupted data.
